          <strong>Why has your risk score gone up suddenly?</strong>
          <br />
          My risk score goes up extremely quickly during crises (such as the
          COVID-19 pandemic) due to me being long stocks and never shorting any
          assets. eToro says even if my risk score rises to 7 though, which is
          normally the point at which Popular Investors (PIs) are removed from
          the programme, they will allow me to remain a PI due to my long term
          and no leverage strategy. Over long periods, my risk score tends to
          revert to a level around 3-5.

          <strong>Do you invest in anything other than stocks on eToro?</strong>
          <br />
          Outside of eToro I invest in gold and cryptocurrencies, although a
          much smaller amount than that which I have invested in stocks. This is
          just to spread my risk a bit and learn more about trading other
          assets.

          <strong> How much should I copy you with?</strong>
          <br />
          I recommend copying me with a $1000 to start with and adding more if
          you feel comfortable doing so.

            Where do you read about the markets and learn more about investing?
          </strong>
          <br />
          I mainly read The Economist and the Financial Times to keep up to date
          with whats going on in the world which aids my investment decisions. I
          also enjoy reading books about technology, economics, history and
          science which also helps me make better investment decisions and learn
          about the world.
