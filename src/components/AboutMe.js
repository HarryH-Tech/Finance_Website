            Iâ€™ve been interested in finance and investing my whole life and
            enjoy reading about economics and businesses as well as science and
            technology.
            <br />
            <br />
            Although I have no academic experience in investing or finance, I've
            learnt a lot about them both through reading and since I started
            investing on eToro in 2017, have outperformed the market every year.
