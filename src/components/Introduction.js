        <strong>Hi there,</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're copying me on eToro (or interested in doing so) then you're in
        the right place. I made this website to give you a better idea about my
        investing ideas and reasons for investing in specific companies. It also
        gives you a way to ask me any questions about my investments, should you
        wish to.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™ve been interested in economics and investing for my whole life and
        still enjoy reading about the history of economic ideas and businesses.
        I also enjoy reading about current affairs as it helps me to understand
        the world and make better investment decisions. On eToro I only invest
        in stocks and ETFs but outside of eToro I also have a small amount of my
        portfolio in gold and silver for diversification and as a hedge against
        unforeseen risk. I also have a small amount of Bitcoin and a few other
        cryptocurrencies more as speculation and just to try and understand more
        about the technology behind them and behave as an asset.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want to sign up to eToro either to copy me and/or just invest
        your money you can use the following{" "}
