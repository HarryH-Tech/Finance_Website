        Hi,
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're copying me on eToro, or interested in doing so, then you're in
        the right place. I made this website to give you more information about
        me and my ideas about investing. It also gives you a way to contact me
        privately if you want to.
        <br />
        <br />
        Iâ€™ve been interested in economics and investing my whole life and still
        enjoy reading about the history of economic ideas and businesses as well
        as science and technology. I also keep up to date with current affairs
        as well the health of the global economy to help me make better
        investment decisions.
        <br />
        <br />
        On eToro I only invest in stocks and ETFs. However outside of eToro I do
        own some Gold and a few cryptocurrencies but this is only to learn more
        about how they behave as an investment as well as the blockchain
        technology behind cryptocurrencies.
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want to sign up to eToro either to copy me and/or invest your
        money you can do so using this{" "}
