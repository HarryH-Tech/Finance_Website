        <strong>Hi,</strong>
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're copying me on eToro (or interested in doing so) then you're in
        the right place. I made this website to give you a better idea about my
        investing ideas and reasons for investing in specific companies. It also
        gives you a way to ask me any questions about my investments privately,
        should you wish to.
        <br />
        <br />
        Although I have no formal education in finance Iâ€™ve been interested in
        economics and investing for my whole life and still enjoy reading about
        the history of economic ideas and businesses. I also enjoy reading about
        current affairs as it helps me to understand the world and make better
        investment decisions. On eToro I only invest in stocks and ETFs .
        <br />
        <br />
        If you want to sign up to eToro either to copy me and/or just invest
        your money you can use the following{" "}

          link
        </a>
        .
        <br />

        Thanks for reading this and I hope you have a great day. ðŸ˜ƒ
