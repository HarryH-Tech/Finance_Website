        Hi there,
        <br />
        <br />
        If you're copying me on eToro (or interested in doing so) then you're in
        the right place. I made this website to give you a better idea about my
        investing ideas and reasons for investing in specific companies. It also
        gives you a way to ask me any questions about my investments, should you
        wish to.
        <br />
        <br />
        <p>
          Iâ€™ve been interested in economics and investing for my whole life and
          still enjoy reading about the history of economic ideas and
          businesses. I also enjoy reading about current affairs as it helps me
          to understand the world and make better investment decisions. On eToro
          I only invest in stocks and ETFs but outside of eToro I also have a
          small amount of my portfolio in gold and silver for diversification
          and as a hedge against unforeseen risk. I also have a small amount of
          Bitcoin and a few other cryptocurrencies more as speculation and just
          to try and understand more about the technology behind them and behave
          as an asset.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I try to invest in well run businesses and use fundamentals to value a
          company rather than using technical analysis or looking at charts. I
          invest for periods of 3+ years as I believe that over a longer period
          a good business will always significantly increase in value. I avoid
          buying stocks that see a large increase in value over a short period
          of time to avoid becoming a victim of buying into a hyped up and
          therefore overvalued stock.
        </p>
        <br />
