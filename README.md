<h1>eToro Website</h1>

**A relatively simple website that I made just to give anyone copying me on the investment platform eToro**

**The live site can be seen at the URL in the description or you can clone the repo then run `npm install` then `npm run start` and navigating to `localhost:3000` in your web browser.**

**If you have any ideas about how I can improve the website I'd love to hear them. You can contact me using the contact form on the website or email me at h.harrison1993@gmail.com**
